    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025‑05‑06</p>

    <h2>About the service</h2>
    <p>Arcade Hub is a browser arcade offering casual games, an XP system, and an optional user account for cloud sync powered by Supabase. You may play as a guest or sign in to save XP and progress.</p>

    <h2>Using Arcade Hub</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must provide accurate email information if you create an account and keep credentials secure.</li>
      <li>Guest mode is available but does not sync XP between devices.</li>
      <li>Accounts are optional; deleting your account will stop cloud sync and remove associated data as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>XP and cloud sync</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>XP earned while signed in is linked to your user ID and stored with Supabase.</li>
      <li>We may adjust XP in cases of abuse, cheating, or technical errors.</li>
      <li>Connectivity issues may delay sync; we aim to retry without losing progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not manipulate XP, use cheat tools, or attempt to hack the service.</li>
      <li>Do not interfere with security, reverse engineer, or disrupt other players.</li>
      <li>Use the service lawfully and respect intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accounts and security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your login details confidential. You are responsible for actions under your account.</li>
      <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms, our Privacy Policy, or applicable law.</li>
      <li>Account deletion currently requires emailing <a class="ft-link" href="mailto:contact@kcswh.pl">contact@kcswh.pl</a>. Automated deletion is planned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content and third parties</h2>
    <p>Some games and services come from third-party providers who may have their own terms and privacy practices. You agree to review and follow any third-party requirements displayed with those games.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimers and liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Arcade Hub is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or error-free operation.</li>
      <li>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages arising from use of the service.</li>
      <li>Nothing in these terms limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes and availability</h2>
    <p>We may update games, XP rules, or these terms. Material changes will be posted with an updated date. We may suspend features for maintenance or security reasons.</p>

    <h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by Polish law. Any disputes will be resolved by the competent courts in Poland.</p>

    <h2>Related documents</h2>
    <p>Please also read our <a class="ft-link" href="privacy.en.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a class="ft-link" href="cookies-notice.en.html">Cookies Notice</a>.</p>
